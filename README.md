# The SuperSpreadSheet Project 

Le S3 was developed in `gtkmm` with C++.

SuperSpreadSheet or S3 is a project to create an interface to the
TransLucid core and library by allowing browsing of dimension and
ordinates, and for now, evaluation of expression. The aim is to allow for
queries and demands and provide a full access to TransLucid hyperdatons.

You can find some blog entries related to this project 
[here](http://superspreadsheet.wordpress.com/category/superspreadsheet/).

The project was put on hold waiting further design development and
implementation of the TransLucid project.
