# The SuperSpreadSheet Project 

Le S3 was developed in `gtkmm` with C++.

SuperSpreadSheet or S3 project was aimed to create an interface to the
TransLucid core and library by allowing browsing of dimension and
ordinates, and at the first stage, the evaluation of expressions. The puspose
was to allow queries, demands and to provide a full access to TransLucid 
hyperdatons.

The hyperdatons represent in reality a multidimensional spreadsheet, a 
multipurpose document. Such document is  a very complex. This implementation 
culminated the proof of concept of the electronic documents.

The project was put on hold waiting the resolution of key design problems, 
followed by development and implementation of the TransLucid language.
