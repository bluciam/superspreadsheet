Known bugs or problems not dealt with:


• Handle the minus sign
• There is absolutely no error checking. Need to catch TL errors,
  perhaps in TLentities :
  1. When an equation defines a dimension not added to the
     header, TL explodes. Need to catch the error.
  2. Factorial of negative numbers explodes
  3. etc
• System dimensions are now in another structure. Need to fix that
  part of the code.
• Instead of (pivot.ords)[dimname] = piv, I should have a function
  on pivot.add(piv);
• ./spreadsheet --header=header-file --equations=equations-file
                --expressions=expressions-file
• New code on filechooserdialog might need improvement.
• display_comp_*() methods can probably be condensed.
• add, delete and modify equations: need to clarify TIME (the
  micro and macro instants) to have Jarryd implement what is
  needed.
